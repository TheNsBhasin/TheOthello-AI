# TheOthello-AI
Othello game with AI implemented with Minimax algorithm optimized with alpha-beta pruning.

# Othello
Othello is a classic strategy video game based on Reversi. First released for Atari 2600 in 1980, later published by Acclaim Entertainment in 1988, it is similar to both chess and checkers.

## Gameplay 
Basically, there are two sided chips (also called discs) on a board. One side is black, and one side is white. Yours are the black chips and your opponents are the white. You can play the computer or another player. The goal is to end the game with as many chips showing your color as possible. To do this, you must sandwich your opponents chip(s) between a piece (showing your own color) currently on the board, and the piece you're putting down.

## AI
Alphaâ€“beta pruning is a search algorithm that seeks to decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax algorithm in its search tree. It is an adversarial search algorithm used commonly for machine playing of two-player games (Tic-tac-toe, Chess, Go, etc.).
